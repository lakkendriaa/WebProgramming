            In IT-2310 week 1, we have learned the basic structrue of an HTML page. <br/ >
        </p>
        <p>
            It is composed of 6 elements... <br/ >
            Doctype which use to serve as the rules for the HTML page. <br/ >
            HTML is similar to the main folder. It is the tortilla in a burrito since it holds the entire sites code together.<br/ >
            Head is the stuff that one won't see presented on the actual page itself. It has the metadata for the site. <br/ >
            Meta which is uncodable data. <br/ >
            Title, pretty self explanatory.<br/ >
            and Body which is all the content that is to be displayed on loaded site From pictures to text.<br/ >
        </p>
